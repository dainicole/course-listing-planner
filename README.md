Project description: We're making a course planner for the CS department where you can easily see the prerequisites for different classes to help decide which classes you should prioritize taking earlier. For example, if you want to take CSE 417, it might have a prerequisite of matrix algebra, which itself needs calculus. Our website would display all of the prerequisites so you don't need to manually search for what each class is. You could also see what other CS courses a given class is a prerequisite for. For example, only after you've taken CSE 361 can you take CSE 422, which is itself a prerequisite for CSE 522, 532, and 542.

<br>
Creative Portion:
<br>1. At the top of our page we have the option to sort the course list either alphabetically or by the course number. At any point a user can toggle the ascending/descending button to reverse the order displayed. 
<br>2. A user is allowed to check off courses they have taken as well as courses they want to take. If they select a course they want to take, then the course card will highlight red, but if a user has taken a course (even if it is selected as a want to take course), then the course card will highlight green. Additionally, the user can also filter the entire list of courses by taken/not taken courses as well as want to take/not wanted courses. Otherwise the default option to display all courses is set. 
<br>3. A user can search for any course in the list by course title or course number, which will filter the list accordingly.
<br>4. A user can change the setting of the webpage from light mode to dark mode. Highlighted course card colors as well as general text colors will change accordingly.
<br>5. A progress bar for required core CS courses is shown at the top of the page. It will update accordingly as a user checks off taken courses that fall under the category. A user can select their specific CS related major to see their specific core requirements and how far they are to completing all the courses.

<br>Ideas for creative portion:
- show history for which classes you've done prereq/postreq trees for (easy click back to them)
- workday integration?
- history of when each class was offered?
- ability to add courses to a comparison list (save to look at later)
- can open courses in new tab?
