Project description: We're making a course planner for the CS department where you can easily see the prerequisites for different classes to help decide which classes you should prioritize taking earlier. For example, if you want to take CSE 417, it might have a prerequisite of matrix algebra, which itself needs calculus. Our website would display all of the prerequisites so you don't need to manually search for what each class is. You could also see what other CS courses a given class is a prerequisite for. For example, only after you've taken CSE 361 can you take CSE 422, which is itself a prerequisite for CSE 522, 532, and 542.


Ideas for creative portion:
- option to sort course list alphabetically or by course number
- option to filter by taken/not taken courses
- option to search for specific course by course title or course name
- show history for which classes you've done prereq/postreq trees for (easy click back to them)
- workday integration?
- history of when each class was offered?
- ability to add courses to a comparison list (save to look at later)
- can open courses in new tab?
- dark mode?
